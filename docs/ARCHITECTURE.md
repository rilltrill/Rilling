# OVERRUN — Architecture & Content Guide

OVERRUN is a mobile-first **arcade on-rails light-gun shooter** (think *House of
the Dead* / *Jurassic Park Arcade*): the camera travels along a rail, stops for
encounters, and the player taps the screen to shoot. Two campaigns — **DEAD
ZONE** (zombies) and **PRIMAL ISLAND** (dinosaurs) — of three stages each, every
stage ending in a boss.

Tech: TypeScript + Three.js + Vite. **All art and audio are procedural** (no
asset files): models are built from primitives at runtime, sounds are
synthesised with WebAudio. Ships as a web app/PWA and as native iOS/Android apps
via Capacitor.

## Coordinate conventions

- Y is up, ground is y = 0 unless `Environment.groundAt` says otherwise. 1 unit = 1 metre.
- **Models face +Z** (Three's `Object3D.lookAt` convention). Character's LEFT is +X.
- The rail rig looks along the rail. In stage scripts, positions are
  **rig-relative `[right, up, forward]`** unless `world: true`.
  `[-3, 0, 12]` = 3 m left, on the ground, 12 m ahead (relative to the rail
  heading at the moment of spawning — not where the camera happens to look).
- `rig.space` is a group that follows the rig. Entities in the `'rig'` frame are
  parented to it (their local coords: +x right, +y up, **-z forward**) and keep
  pace with a moving vehicle. Use `RailRig.rel([r,u,f])` to convert.

## Stage scripting (see `gameplay/StageTypes.ts`)

A `StageDef` = rail points + `buildEnvironment()` + ordered `beats`:

| beat | what happens | ends when |
|---|---|---|
| `move` | rig travels to rail distance `to` at `speed` m/s; optional `waves` (chasers) | arrived (+ cleared if `waitClear`) |
| `hold` | rig stops; `waves` spawn | all waves spawned and every hostile dead (or `timeout`) |
| `boss` | spawns registered boss id; optional `moveTo`/`speed` for chases | boss removed (death anim done) |
| `banner` | title card | `duration` |
| `wait` | nothing | `duration` |
| `action` | run code (doors, explosions, scenery changes); may return a Promise | promise resolves |

Every beat may set `look` (camera target), `mode` ('walk' | 'drive'),
`weapon` ('turret' for vehicle mounted guns, null to clear), `pickups`,
`civilians`, `onStart`, `onEnd`.

Waves: each starts when the previous wave is cleared, or by `start.after`
(seconds into the beat), `start.remaining` (≤ N hostiles left) or `start.atD`
(rig distance, move beats). Spawn entries support `t`, `count`, `every`,
`offset`, `entry` ('walk' | 'rise' | 'drop' | 'leap' | 'burst' | 'fly'),
`frame`, `hp`/`speed` multipliers and free-form `opts`.

**Pacing targets.** A stage should last ~3–5 minutes for a decent player:
6–10 encounters + a boss fight of 45–90 s. Rail length typically 250–600 m.
Walking speed 2.5–4 m/s; vehicles 8–18 m/s. Give the player breathing room
between encounters, a pickup every encounter or two, 1–3 civilian rescues per
stage, and at least one "surprise" moment (something bursting through a wall,
dropping from above, a vehicle crash).

## Enemies (see `gameplay/Enemy.ts`, reference: `content/enemies/zombies.ts` Walker)

Subclass `Enemy`:
1. `configure()` — stats: `maxHp`, `speed`, `attackRange`, `windup`, `damage`,
   `points`, sounds, `bloodColor`, `superArmor`, `telegraphRadius`.
2. `build()` — meshes under `this.model` (facing +Z, feet at y = 0); register
   hit zones with `this.hitbox(mesh, 'head' | 'torso' | 'limb' | 'tail' | 'weak' | 'armor' | 'body')`;
   set `this.anchor` (chest) and `this.headAnchor`.
3. `animate(dt)` — procedural animation from `state`, `stateTime`,
   `groundSpeed`, `age`. Don't move `root` here (AI does), animate joints.
4. Optional hooks: `onWindup`, `strike` (default melee; ranged enemies throw a
   `Projectile`), `onDamaged`, `onDeath`, `updateDeath`, `customUpdate` (for
   custom string states set via `setState('leap')`), `entryUpdate`,
   `advanceUpdate`, `damageMultiplier`.

`build()` must not touch anything outside `this.model` / `this.root` that
`dispose()` wouldn't undo: stage loading builds a detached copy of every enemy
type (`Enemy.buildDetached()`, no `onAdded`) to compile its shaders up front.
Do world wiring (camera focus, scene helpers, sounds) in `onAdded()`.

Default AI: entry → advance to `attackRange` → **windup** (a shrinking red
ring on screen; the player must kill/stagger it in `windup` seconds) → strike
(1 heart) → recover → repeat. Any hit during windup staggers (unless
`superArmor`). At most 3 regular enemies wind up at once (`World.attackSlots`).
Part multipliers: head ×2.5, torso ×1, limb ×0.7, tail ×0.5, weak ×2, armor ×0.

Damage numbers to design around: pistol 1/shot, shotgun 8×0.65, SMG 0.55,
magnum 4 (pierces), turret 0.8. A basic walker has 2.5 hp (one headshot).

Register: `registerEnemy('walker', (w, s) => new Walker(w, s))`. Ids used by
stages must exist (`content/registry.ts` lists the canonical roster).

## Bosses (see `gameplay/Boss.ts`)

Extend `Boss`: set `title` (health-bar name), `maxHp`, `phases`; register
small surface weak points (eyes) before large/inner ones (the AutoPlayer prefers
unobstructed weak parts in registration order); register
'weak' meshes (glowing) and 'armor' meshes; implement the fight in
`customUpdate` with custom states. Helpers: `telegraphAttack(duration, onLand)`,
`throwProjectile(fromWorldPos, opts)`, `phaseFor()`, `onPhase()`. Bosses must
be **killable by the autoplayer in < 120 s** (the simulator checks) and every
attack must be telegraphed (ring) and avoidable by shooting. When a boss's
`telegraph` appears (null → set), `World` vents an overheated mounted gun
(`WeaponSystem.vent()`: heat ≤ 35 %, lockout cleared) so a turret player can
always answer the windup. Register the boss
id from the stage folder (e.g. `registerEnemy('butcher', …)`).

## Model kit rules (see `content/kit/ModelKit.ts`)

- Use `Kit.mat/glow/std` and `Kit.box/sphere/cyl/cone/capsule/ico` — they're
  cached and shared. **Never mutate** a Kit geometry or material.
- Custom geometry/material/texture → wrap in `Kit.track()` so it's disposed.
- Per-instance colour changes: pick a different cached material instead.
- Static scenery: build into a Group then `EnvKit.mergeStatic(group)` to cut
  draw calls (keep shootables/occluders/animated things out of merged groups).
- Mobile budget per frame: aim for < 250 draw calls, < 150k triangles,
  ≤ 4 dynamic lights (hemisphere + directional + a couple of point lights),
  no shadow maps. Use fog to limit view distance.

## Retro look (textures + arcade monitor)

- `content/kit/Textures.ts` generates 26 tiny procedural pixel textures (brick,
  asphalt, metal, tiles, bark, leaves, scales, hide, skin, cloth, hazard…) as
  DataTextures: limited grey levels, ordered dithering, NEAREST magnification.
  They are detail maps multiplied with the material colour.
- Use them with `Kit.mat(color, { tex: 'brick', texScale: 1 })` or
  `Kit.tex('brick', color)`. Projection is object-space planar on the dominant
  normal axis, so **no UVs are needed** and texel density stays constant in world
  units (also inside `EnvKit.mergeStatic` groups). `texScale` > 1 = smaller texels
  (characters typically 2–4). `Kit.retro.grain` adds a subtle grit to every
  untextured `Kit.mat`.
- Texel density guidance (58° vertical FOV at 288 lines ≈ 0.385 cm per pixel per
  metre of distance): for chunky, readable texels use texScale ≈ 0.3–0.7 for
  environment surfaces (road 0.6, ground 0.3, cliffs 0.3, canopy 0.4–0.55), ≈ 0.9
  with strength ≈ 0.7 for close fast-moving foliage, 1.5–2 for big creatures and
  2–4 for human-sized characters. `Kit.mat` stores `userData.retroTex/retroScale/
  retroStrength` so bakers can carry them into merged vertex-coloured batches.
- Screenshots of the CRT look: `node scripts/snap.mjs --url "…&retro=crt" --retroScale 1`.
- `core/RetroPass.ts` renders the scene into a ~288-line target (by quality:
  224/288/360) and upscales it with 15-bit-style dithered colour quantisation and,
  in 'crt' mode, scanlines, curvature, convergence error, phosphor bloom and
  vignette. Settings → DISPLAY: CRT / PIXEL / OFF (`Settings.retro`).

## Art style: SPRITES (pixel-art characters, `gameplay/SpriteArt.ts`)

Settings → ART: **3D | SPRITES** (`Settings.art`, URL `&art=sprites|3d`; live, also
mid-stage from the pause menu's SETTINGS). In SPRITES every character — enemies,
bosses, civilians — plus projectiles, pickups and severed limbs is drawn as a 2D
pixel-art sprite, the way 90s arcade shooters used pre-rendered sprites.

- **Live impostors.** `SpriteArt.beginFrame()` (called by `Game.renderWorld`
  around `engine.render`) re-renders each visible sprite source about 12×/s of
  game time (`SPRITE_FPS`, round-robin, ≤ 6 bakes per frame; never-drawn ones
  first) — so animation is choppy like sprite frames while positions stay smooth.
- **Bake.** The bake camera is the main camera with its projection *cropped* to the
  source's on-screen bounds (no perspective mismatch), rendered at ~1.5 retro
  pixels per texel (`pxPerTexel`, size caps 192 / 448 texels for bosses — close-ups
  get chunkier), 2× supersampled, into a 512² HDR scratch target with a depth
  texture. Lights are mirrored into a tiny bake scene (same light set → same
  shader programs; `precompile` warms the offscreen variants) with the stage fog.
- **Pixel-art pass** (`BAKE_FRAG`) into the sprite's own small RGBA8 target (pooled
  by power-of-two size): crisp alpha, a 1-px dark outline (inside the silhouette
  for big sprites, around it for small ones), inner contour lines where a part
  overlaps another, a top-lit silhouette rim, log-luminance posterisation and a
  little extra saturation. Each texel's view depth is packed into alpha.
- **Display.** A screen-aligned quad per sprite follows the entity's root every
  frame and writes **per-texel depth** (`gl_FragDepth`), so scenery occludes
  sprites (and sprites each other) as the 3D models would. Hit flashes tint the
  whole sprite white/red (`Enemy.flashKind`). Characters get a chunky blob shadow
  (one instanced draw for all).
- **Gameplay is untouched.** The 3D models keep animating and are the hitboxes;
  they are only hidden (`root.visible = false`) for the main camera's draw and
  restored in `endFrame()`, so raycasts, aim assist, AutoPlayer and the
  simulator see exactly what they saw before. A source without an image yet
  (just spawned off screen) falls back to its 3D model — never invisible.
- Tuning: `&spriteLook=k:2,bands:0,outline:0.3,inner:0,rim:0,ss:1,shadows:0`
  (see `SpriteLook`). A/B captures of the same frozen instant:
  `node scripts/snap-art.mjs --shots "z1:4,d3:16:6000" --modes "3d,sprites"`;
  deterministic draw-call / bake numbers: `node scripts/bench-art.mjs`.
- Cost: a bake is the source's own draw calls + 1; with ~4 bakes per frame the
  sprite path draws far fewer calls than 3D (characters are drawn ~12×/s instead
  of 60×/s). Memory: 3 MB scratch + a few KB–1 MB per sprite (≈ 3–5 MB total).

## Audio

`audio/`: `Audio.ts` (buses, voice pool, pre-render cache, ducking, iOS unlock,
background sample bake), `Sfx.ts` (recipes) + `sfxMeta.ts` (per-sound limits /
caching / trim), `Music.ts` + `tracks.ts` (sequencer + compositions; chord
notation, `validateTracks()`; layers follow `setIntensity`), `drums.ts` /
`dsp.ts` / `bake.ts` (time-sliced sample synthesis + DSP helpers). New sounds:
add the name to `names.ts`, a recipe to `Sfx.ts` and a row to `sfxMeta.ts`. Use
`pitch < 1` for bigger creatures; sounds are loudness-matched, so use `volume`
only for distance/emphasis. Enemy sounds are panned by screen position.

## FX

`fx/`: pooled particles with a generated sprite atlas, instanced gibs with blood
trails, ground decals (blood, scorch, bullet marks) that fade, explosions with
fireball/shockwave/smoke, `muzzleFlash()` (wired in `Shooter.fire`). Occluders may
set `userData.surface = 'metal' | 'wood' | 'concrete' | 'dirt' | 'grass' | 'water'`
to pick impact effects per object.

## Weapons, pickups, bombs

- Turret heat: +3 % per shot; a pause of > 0.12 s bleeds heat at 1/s (feathering
  never locks you out); holding flat out overheats in ~2.8 s and locks the gun
  until it cools to 35 % (~1.1 s) — unless a boss windup vents it (see Bosses).
- Pickups blink for their last 2 s by hiding the model only: `Entity.shootableWhenHidden`
  keeps the hitboxes in `Shootables.active()`, so a shot on a flashing item still
  collects it. Pickups left when a beat ends live 6 s more (`LEFTOVER_PICKUP_TTL`).
  Pickup halo/gem geometry is shared (`userData.shared`).
- `World.useBomb()` ignores a second bomb within 0.75 s (`bombCooldown()` for the
  HUD) and spends nothing when no hostile is in reach (`bombTargets()`; it pops
  NO TARGETS).
- Aim assist probes only the shootable meshes (25 rays) and checks walls with one
  occluder ray per candidate; the occluder raycast is skipped for clean misses of
  extra shotgun pellets. Still: keep occluders low-poly proxies (12-triangle boxes
  with `userData.surface`) — never pass detailed baked shells.

## Comfort & accessibility settings

`world.settings` is the live Settings object (the settings screen edits it mid-stage).
- `reduceFlashes`: Fx explosion light flashes are dimmer (30 %) and can't re-fire
  within 0.4 s, the blast core sprite and muzzle-flash light are toned down, enemy
  hit flashes are capped at ~3/s, pickups blink slower. **Stage code with its own
  flashes (lightning, strobing alarms, flickering lights) must check
  `world.settings.reduceFlashes`** and tone them down (no full-screen brightening).
- `screenShake` 0..1: scales `RailRig.shake()` (and walk-bob / vehicle rumble by half).
- First run: when the OS asks for reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion`),
  `Save` defaults to `reduceFlashes: true, screenShake: 0.5`.

## Stage loading

`Game.startStage` shows the intro card (or keeps the pressed RETRY/RESTART
screen) first and builds the stage two frames later, so the UI paints before the
0.4–1 s build. Then `Warmup.buildWarmupSet` builds throwaway copies of every
enemy type in the beats (plus the campaign roster), each pickup kind and civilian
variant, and `Engine.precompile` compiles their programs (and the scenery's) with
the retro target bound; play starts when both the card and the load are done.
State `'loading'` covers loads without a card. Stage set pieces that add **lights**
or new material types mid-stage still compile then: add such lights at build time
(intensity 0) and keep set-piece meshes in the scene (hidden) from the start.

## Renderer policy

- Output DPR: one rule (`Engine.outputDpr`): CRT/PIXEL LOW 1.5 / MEDIUM 2 / HIGH 2,
  clean mode = the quality preset's max; always capped by the device. MSAA only
  in clean mode HIGH (decided at boot).
- Dynamic resolution (`core/Resolution.ts`): slow windows start a probe that steps
  down (retro: scene lines 1 → 0.7, then output DPR → 1); if 3 steps don't make
  frames faster it's a refresh cap (Low Power Mode), so it reverts and holds.
- WebGL context loss: the game pauses ("GRAPHICS RESET"), RESUME is refused until
  the context is restored; frozen frames (pause/results/continue/intro) are only
  re-rendered when the canvas was resized or cleared.

## Performance & feel checklist

- Telegraph everything that can hurt the player.
- Hit feedback: flash, blood/sparks, knockback, sounds — base classes do most of it.
- Use `world.rig.shake()`, `world.hud.banner()`, `world.audio.play()`,
  `world.fx.*`, `world.explode()` and `world.later(sec, fn)` (game-time timers).
- Never use `setTimeout`/`setInterval` in gameplay code (breaks pause / the simulator).
- Never use `Math.random()` in gameplay code: use `world.rng` (seeded).

## Debug URL flags

`?stage=z1` jump into a stage · `&art=sprites|3d` character art (Settings ART) ·
`&spriteLook=k:2` sprite look tuning · `&beat=5` start at beat 5 · `&autoplay=1`
aimbot · `&god=1` invulnerable · `&speed=2` time scale · `&debug=1` beat
overlay · `&seed=42` · `&mute=1` · `&retro=crt|pixel|off` force the arcade-monitor
mode (`?stage`/`?autoplay` deep links render with retro OFF unless `retro` is
given, so tooling gets clean captures) · `?stage=zoo&zoo=walker,raptor` dev arena.
`window.__game` exposes the game for tests; `Menus.current` names the top screen.

## Arcade front-end

- Boot POST screen once per session → title (`PRESS START`, `FREE PLAY`, 1P/HI row).
- Attract cycle: title idle 15 s → HI-SCORES 6 s → `Game` state `'demo'` for 25 s
  (AutoPlayer + god, a stage fast-forwarded to the next fight; never records
  scores/unlocks, no tutorial/intro). Any tap → main menu.
- Hi-scores: per-campaign top-10 tables in `Save` (`hiScores`, `hiScoreRank`,
  `qualifies`, `addHiScore`, `topHiScore`, `lastInitials`). An ARCADE run that
  ends (campaign clear, game over, quit) with a qualifying total goes to 3-letter
  NAME ENTRY. RETRY/RESTART replace that stage's score; continues are recorded.
- The 2D overlay follows `engine.retro.targetSize` (`Overlay2D.setPixelGrid`) so
  rings/crosshairs are drawn on the same chunky pixel grid as the 3D.

## Verifying changes

```
npx tsc --noEmit                         # typecheck
npx vitest run                           # unit tests + headless stage simulator
npx vitest run tests/unit/stages.test.ts -t "stage z1"   # one stage
npx vite --port 5173                     # dev server

     --out /tmp/shots/z1 --count 4 --interval 3000      # screenshots (then view the PNGs)
```

The stage simulator (`tests/unit/sim.ts`) plays every stage headlessly with the
real World, raycast shooting and the AutoPlayer in god mode, and fails on
exceptions, soft-locks, unreachable enemies or unkillable bosses.
