# OVERRUN — Architecture & Content Guide

OVERRUN is a mobile-first **arcade on-rails light-gun shooter** (think *House of
the Dead* / *Jurassic Park Arcade*): the camera travels along a rail, stops for
encounters, and the player taps the screen to shoot. Two campaigns — **DEAD
ZONE** (zombies) and **PRIMAL ISLAND** (dinosaurs) — of three stages each, every
stage ending in a boss.

Tech: TypeScript + Three.js + Vite. **All art and audio are procedural** (no
asset files): models are built from primitives at runtime, sounds are
synthesised with WebAudio. Ships as a web app/PWA and as native iOS/Android apps
via Capacitor.

## Coordinate conventions

- Y is up, ground is y = 0 unless `Environment.groundAt` says otherwise. 1 unit = 1 metre.
- **Models face +Z** (Three's `Object3D.lookAt` convention). Character's LEFT is +X.
- The rail rig looks along the rail. In stage scripts, positions are
  **rig-relative `[right, up, forward]`** unless `world: true`.
  `[-3, 0, 12]` = 3 m left, on the ground, 12 m ahead (relative to the rail
  heading at the moment of spawning — not where the camera happens to look).
- `rig.space` is a group that follows the rig. Entities in the `'rig'` frame are
  parented to it (their local coords: +x right, +y up, **-z forward**) and keep
  pace with a moving vehicle. Use `RailRig.rel([r,u,f])` to convert.

## Stage scripting (see `gameplay/StageTypes.ts`)

A `StageDef` = rail points + `buildEnvironment()` + ordered `beats`:

| beat | what happens | ends when |
|---|---|---|
| `move` | rig travels to rail distance `to` at `speed` m/s; optional `waves` (chasers) | arrived (+ cleared if `waitClear`) |
| `hold` | rig stops; `waves` spawn | all waves spawned and every hostile dead (or `timeout`) |
| `boss` | spawns registered boss id; optional `moveTo`/`speed` for chases | boss removed (death anim done) |
| `banner` | title card | `duration` |
| `wait` | nothing | `duration` |
| `action` | run code (doors, explosions, scenery changes); may return a Promise | promise resolves |

Every beat may set `look` (camera target), `mode` ('walk' | 'drive'),
`weapon` ('turret' for vehicle mounted guns, null to clear), `pickups`,
`civilians`, `onStart`, `onEnd`.

Waves: each starts when the previous wave is cleared, or by `start.after`
(seconds into the beat), `start.remaining` (≤ N hostiles left) or `start.atD`
(rig distance, move beats). Spawn entries support `t`, `count`, `every`,
`offset`, `entry` ('walk' | 'rise' | 'drop' | 'leap' | 'burst' | 'fly'),
`frame`, `hp`/`speed` multipliers and free-form `opts`.

**Pacing targets.** A stage should last ~3–5 minutes for a decent player:
6–10 encounters + a boss fight of 45–90 s. Rail length typically 250–600 m.
Walking speed 2.5–4 m/s; vehicles 8–18 m/s. Give the player breathing room
between encounters, a pickup every encounter or two, 1–3 civilian rescues per
stage, and at least one "surprise" moment (something bursting through a wall,
dropping from above, a vehicle crash).

## Enemies (see `gameplay/Enemy.ts`, reference: `content/enemies/zombies.ts` Walker)

Subclass `Enemy`:
1. `configure()` — stats: `maxHp`, `speed`, `attackRange`, `windup`, `damage`,
   `points`, sounds, `bloodColor`, `superArmor`, `telegraphRadius`.
2. `build()` — meshes under `this.model` (facing +Z, feet at y = 0); register
   hit zones with `this.hitbox(mesh, 'head' | 'torso' | 'limb' | 'tail' | 'weak' | 'armor' | 'body')`;
   set `this.anchor` (chest) and `this.headAnchor`.
3. `animate(dt)` — procedural animation from `state`, `stateTime`,
   `groundSpeed`, `age`. Don't move `root` here (AI does), animate joints.
4. Optional hooks: `onWindup`, `strike` (default melee; ranged enemies throw a
   `Projectile`), `onDamaged`, `onDeath`, `updateDeath`, `customUpdate` (for
   custom string states set via `setState('leap')`), `entryUpdate`,
   `advanceUpdate`, `damageMultiplier`.

Default AI: entry → advance to `attackRange` → **windup** (a shrinking red
ring on screen; the player must kill/stagger it in `windup` seconds) → strike
(1 heart) → recover → repeat. Any hit during windup staggers (unless
`superArmor`). At most 3 regular enemies wind up at once (`World.attackSlots`).
Part multipliers: head ×2.5, torso ×1, limb ×0.7, tail ×0.5, weak ×2, armor ×0.

Damage numbers to design around: pistol 1/shot, shotgun 8×0.65, SMG 0.55,
magnum 4 (pierces), turret 0.8. A basic walker has 2.5 hp (one headshot).

Register: `registerEnemy('walker', (w, s) => new Walker(w, s))`. Ids used by
stages must exist (`content/registry.ts` lists the canonical roster).

## Bosses (see `gameplay/Boss.ts`)

Extend `Boss`: set `title` (health-bar name), `maxHp`, `phases`; register
small surface weak points (eyes) before large/inner ones (the AutoPlayer prefers
unobstructed weak parts in registration order); register
'weak' meshes (glowing) and 'armor' meshes; implement the fight in
`customUpdate` with custom states. Helpers: `telegraphAttack(duration, onLand)`,
`throwProjectile(fromWorldPos, opts)`, `phaseFor()`, `onPhase()`. Bosses must
be **killable by the autoplayer in < 120 s** (the simulator checks) and every
attack must be telegraphed (ring) and avoidable by shooting. Register the boss
id from the stage folder (e.g. `registerEnemy('butcher', …)`).

## Model kit rules (see `content/kit/ModelKit.ts`)

- Use `Kit.mat/glow/std` and `Kit.box/sphere/cyl/cone/capsule/ico` — they're
  cached and shared. **Never mutate** a Kit geometry or material.
- Custom geometry/material/texture → wrap in `Kit.track()` so it's disposed.
- Per-instance colour changes: pick a different cached material instead.
- Static scenery: build into a Group then `EnvKit.mergeStatic(group)` to cut
  draw calls (keep shootables/occluders/animated things out of merged groups).
- Mobile budget per frame: aim for < 250 draw calls, < 150k triangles,
  ≤ 4 dynamic lights (hemisphere + directional + a couple of point lights),
  no shadow maps. Use fog to limit view distance.

## Retro look (textures + arcade monitor)

- `content/kit/Textures.ts` generates 26 tiny procedural pixel textures (brick,
  asphalt, metal, tiles, bark, leaves, scales, hide, skin, cloth, hazard…) as
  DataTextures: limited grey levels, ordered dithering, NEAREST magnification.
  They are detail maps multiplied with the material colour.
- Use them with `Kit.mat(color, { tex: 'brick', texScale: 1 })` or
  `Kit.tex('brick', color)`. Projection is object-space planar on the dominant
  normal axis, so **no UVs are needed** and texel density stays constant in world
  units (also inside `EnvKit.mergeStatic` groups). `texScale` > 1 = smaller texels
  (characters typically 2–4). `Kit.retro.grain` adds a subtle grit to every
  untextured `Kit.mat`.
- Texel density guidance (58° vertical FOV at 288 lines ≈ 0.385 cm per pixel per
  metre of distance): for chunky, readable texels use texScale ≈ 0.3–0.7 for
  environment surfaces (road 0.6, ground 0.3, cliffs 0.3, canopy 0.4–0.55), ≈ 0.9
  with strength ≈ 0.7 for close fast-moving foliage, 1.5–2 for big creatures and
  2–4 for human-sized characters. `Kit.mat` stores `userData.retroTex/retroScale/
  retroStrength` so bakers can carry them into merged vertex-coloured batches.
- Screenshots of the CRT look: `node scripts/snap.mjs --url "…&retro=crt" --retroScale 1`.
- `core/RetroPass.ts` renders the scene into a ~288-line target (by quality:
  224/288/360) and upscales it with 15-bit-style dithered colour quantisation and,
  in 'crt' mode, scanlines, curvature, convergence error, phosphor bloom and
  vignette. Settings → DISPLAY: CRT / PIXEL / OFF (`Settings.retro`).

## Audio

`audio/`: `Audio.ts` (buses, voice pool, pre-render cache, ducking, iOS unlock,
background sample bake), `Sfx.ts` (recipes) + `sfxMeta.ts` (per-sound limits /
caching / trim), `Music.ts` + `tracks.ts` (sequencer + compositions; chord
notation, `validateTracks()`; layers follow `setIntensity`), `drums.ts` /
`dsp.ts` / `bake.ts` (time-sliced sample synthesis + DSP helpers). New sounds:
add the name to `names.ts`, a recipe to `Sfx.ts` and a row to `sfxMeta.ts`. Use
`pitch < 1` for bigger creatures; sounds are loudness-matched, so use `volume`
only for distance/emphasis. Enemy sounds are panned by screen position.

## FX

`fx/`: pooled particles with a generated sprite atlas, instanced gibs with blood
trails, ground decals (blood, scorch, bullet marks) that fade, explosions with
fireball/shockwave/smoke, `muzzleFlash()` (wired in `Shooter.fire`). Occluders may
set `userData.surface = 'metal' | 'wood' | 'concrete' | 'dirt' | 'grass' | 'water'`
to pick impact effects per object.

## Performance & feel checklist

- Telegraph everything that can hurt the player.
- Hit feedback: flash, blood/sparks, knockback, sounds — base classes do most of it.
- Use `world.rig.shake()`, `world.hud.banner()`, `world.audio.play()`,
  `world.fx.*`, `world.explode()` and `world.later(sec, fn)` (game-time timers).
- Never use `setTimeout`/`setInterval` in gameplay code (breaks pause / the simulator).
- Never use `Math.random()` in gameplay code: use `world.rng` (seeded).

## Debug URL flags

`?stage=z1` jump into a stage · `&beat=5` start at beat 5 · `&autoplay=1`
aimbot · `&god=1` invulnerable · `&speed=2` time scale · `&debug=1` beat
overlay · `&seed=42` · `&mute=1` · `&retro=crt|pixel|off` force the arcade-monitor
mode (`?stage`/`?autoplay` deep links render with retro OFF unless `retro` is
given, so tooling gets clean captures) · `?stage=zoo&zoo=walker,raptor` dev arena.
`window.__game` exposes the game for tests; `Menus.current` names the top screen.

## Arcade front-end

- Boot POST screen once per session → title (`PRESS START`, `FREE PLAY`, 1P/HI row).
- Attract cycle: title idle 15 s → HI-SCORES 6 s → `Game` state `'demo'` for 25 s
  (AutoPlayer + god, a stage fast-forwarded to the next fight; never records
  scores/unlocks, no tutorial/intro). Any tap → main menu.
- Hi-scores: per-campaign top-10 tables in `Save` (`hiScores`, `hiScoreRank`,
  `qualifies`, `addHiScore`, `topHiScore`, `lastInitials`). An ARCADE run that
  ends (campaign clear, game over, quit) with a qualifying total goes to 3-letter
  NAME ENTRY. RETRY/RESTART replace that stage's score; continues are recorded.
- The 2D overlay follows `engine.retro.targetSize` (`Overlay2D.setPixelGrid`) so
  rings/crosshairs are drawn on the same chunky pixel grid as the 3D.

## Verifying changes

```
npx tsc --noEmit                         # typecheck
npx vitest run                           # unit tests + headless stage simulator
npx vitest run tests/unit/stages.test.ts -t "stage z1"   # one stage
npx vite --port 5173                     # dev server
node scripts/snap.mjs --url "http://localhost:5173/?stage=z1&autoplay=1&god=1&debug=1" \
     --out /tmp/shots/z1 --count 4 --interval 3000      # screenshots (then view the PNGs)
```

The stage simulator (`tests/unit/sim.ts`) plays every stage headlessly with the
real World, raycast shooting and the AutoPlayer in god mode, and fails on
exceptions, soft-locks, unreachable enemies or unkillable bosses.
